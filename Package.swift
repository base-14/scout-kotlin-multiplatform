import PackageDescription

// Public Swift Package Manager manifest for the Scout iOS SDK, consumed as:
//   https://github.com/base-14/scout-kotlin-multiplatform  (pin to an `ios-<version>` tag)
//
// `ScoutNative` is the Kotlin/Native engine, distributed as a hosted xcframework attached to the
// matching `ios-<version>` GitHub Release. The publish-ios workflow builds the xcframework,
// uploads Scout.xcframework.zip to the release, and rewrites the `url` + `checksum` below.
// `ScoutKit` is the Swift layer (public API + auto-instrumentation), compiled from source.
